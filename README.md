HTML of Website

Created a webpage using HTML.  No CSS or JavaScript.  Getting more into the bare bones of things.  The parameters was at least 3 pages that linked from one to another.  Also had to incorporate: a list, a table, and a form.  I chose to make a play off Among Us.  All pics aren't mine, so I take no credit for them.  Just there for the topic of choice.  Index 1 introduces one to the page.  Index 2 lists out the different members of the "team" and their various traits.  The last Index then asks if you want to apply then fill out the form.
